# Sprockets::Babel

This gem merges work from [Sprockets Traceur](https://github.com/gunpowderlabs/sprockets-traceur)
and [Sprockets ES6](https://github.com/josh/sprockets-es6) to create a version that uses Babel as
the ES6 transpiler in a Sprockets 2.x environment.

This is intended as a temporary solution until Sprockets 2.x can be upgraded.
